Error analyzing
It seems there was an issue accessing the contents of the "MERN-Signup-Login-App-main" ZIP file. In such cases, it's beneficial to manually extract and review the contents on your local system.

However, based on the file name, it appears to be a MERN stack application, which typically involves MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for building signup and login functionalities. I can provide a generic template for a README.md file tailored to a MERN stack project, which you can modify as per the specific details of your project.
